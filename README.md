# Encryption Services
This repository contains open source encryption algorithms that might help some other dev's out there in the world

# About 
Encryption is a useful tool when it comes to hiding your data (plain text), and protecting the data from bad actors. 

# How it works ?
This encryption algorithm works by hashing the individual charcters in a string with salting data, pepering data, indexing data and anchor data. Encryption is a two-way function that includes encryption and decryption whilst hashing is a one-way function that changes a plain text to a unique digest that is irreversible 

## What is Salting Data ? 
Salting data comes from the implication of salting technique. Salting is a technique that adds random data, or a salt, to a hash string before hashing it to make hashed output more secure

## What is Pepering Data ?
Pepering data is the direct output of the pepering technique. Peppering is a method of increasing the security of a hashed string by adding a secret value, called a pepper, to the string before hashing

## What is Indexing Data ?
Index data is the output guide of which hash combination results. This helps reveal in the system which hash combination is which char. 

# Disclaimer
This encryption script is safer than using plaintext data, I Wont say its perfect but it gets the job done.
Its not 100% secure, (not because the encryption scripts is public). but because there is never anything 100% secure especially if you can reverse the encryption.

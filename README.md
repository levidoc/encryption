# About 
Encryption is a useful tool when it comes to hiding your data (plain text), and protecting the data from bad actors. 

# Disclaimer
This encryption script is safer than using plaintext data, I Wont say its perfect but it gets the job done.
Its not 100% secure, (not because the encryption scripts is public). but because there is never anything 100% secure especially if you can reverse the encryption.
